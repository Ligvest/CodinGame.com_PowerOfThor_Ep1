Assignment description:

Your program must allow Thor to reach the light of power.

Thor moves on a map which is 40 wide by 18 high. Note that the coordinates (X and Y) start at the top left! This means the most top left cell has the coordinates "X=0,Y=0" and the most bottom right one has the coordinates "X=39,Y=17".

Once the program starts 4 numbers are read:
Light x coordinate
Light y coordinate
Thor x coordinate
Thor y coordinate

At the end of the game turn, you must output the direction in which you want Thor to go among:

"N" (for North), "NE" (for North-East), "E" (for East), "SE" (for South-East), "S" (for South), "SW" (for South-West), "W" (for West), "NW" (for North-West)
